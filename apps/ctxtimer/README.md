# CtxTimer

Simple contraction timer

## Features

very basic at this point

## How to use it

- press BTN1 to start a contraction, or to restart one if started too early
- press BTN2 to stop a contraction
- press BTN3 to cancel a contraction if it was started too early.

- hold down BTN3 to exit. No persistence, keeps the screen on.

### Results

- the time (24 hour clock)
- `@:` this is the time you last pressed BTN1 (start of 'this' ctx)
- `Dur` this is the duration of the most recent contraction
- `P@` this is the time of the prior contraction
- `PDur` this is the duration of the prior contraction
- `Freq` this is the time between the prior contraction's end and the current contraction's starrt
- `Quiet` this is the time between the most recent contraction's end, and now.
